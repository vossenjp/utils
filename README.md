# utils
Various useful utils and bash settings

**Do not run any of this code without reading and understand it!**

## Introduction

This is the "local" code I sync to all the nodes I manage.  Some of it is not production quality and I wrote some of it decades ago, so there may be better ways or better tools.  But it's what I have.  I share it in case it's useful to someone else.  Some of the ideas may have come out of the _Bash Cookbook_ but some of them went into it.  Some of the code came right off the internet, and some was adapted; either should be cited.

I sync it to `/opt/bin/` because that's reasonably discoverable and short, system-wide, yet distinct from `/usr/local/bin/` or similar.  I keep it in Subversion because I like keyword expansion and do not like Git, so I use both `svn` and `git` together to only publish what I want to here.

Some of the code or settings might make sense only to me or my environment, so **read** the code first.  In particular, `drake` is my internal "services" server and `hamilton` is my mail relay, both are references to authors I like, and not musical.  Also, there might be code derived from or handlers for $WORK things, in particular Counterpane (CIS).  Since that tech is now defunct I'm not going to worry too much.


## Installing

Just clone the repo someplace and use whichever files you want.  Do not run any of this code without reading and understand it!


## Use

1. Try `<PROGRAM> -h` or `<PROGRAM> --help` (works for most, but not all!)
2. Read the code


## List

The **`cl`** "clean Up script" is probably the most handy tool I have.  It's a filter that reads from the GUI clipboard, does some arbitrary thing, then writes the results back to the GUI clipboard.  It does almost _all the things_ for me but it's an odd work-flow.  I like it because I can make it to arbitrary things using bash or Perl one-liners, and I'm not stuck with 37 different macro languages.  Whatever GUI tool I happen to be using: select > copy > ALT-TAB to terminal > `cl whatever` > ALT-TAB back > paste.


### Tools:

* `DNSlookup.pl` Lookup IPAs and get hostnames

* `changelog` Trivial system CHANGELOG wrapper to maintain a `/root/CHANGELOG.txt` (crufty style)
* `chperm` Set owner.group and mode/permissions on a given file in 1 step
* `cl` **Clean Up script**, most wiki markup is Zim syntax, but there is Redmine and Jira in there too and some features require `pandoc` or other external tools

* `srpmx` Extract files from a source RPM (requires `rpm2cpio` binary, find that elsewhere)
* `sshfsw` Trivial SSHFS wrapper (SSH File System = FUSE = Awesome!)
* `sysstat` Display some system stats (e.g. run from cron periodically) (Obsolete?  Probably lots of better tools out there!)

* `whatdeb` (or `whatrpm`) Quick and Dirty find for installed RPMs or DEBs
* `zim2wiki.pl` Trivially convert Zim markup to Redmine or Mediawiki


### Settings:

These are the settings or configs that I use everywhere, every day.

* `settings/README` Quick summary of bash init and rc files
* `settings/bash_logout` Clear the screen on logout to prevent information leaks
* `settings/bash_profile` Login shell environment settings
* `settings/bashrc` Subshell environment settings

### Special & Dangerous

*Do not run any of this code without reading and understand it!*  These can trash your hard drives and destroy all your data!  They worked for me, for how *I* set things up and how *I* do things.  Do not run these without understanding exactly what they do and modifying them to fit your environment!  You have been warned.

* `grow_mirrored_disk` Grow a Linux software mirror after swapping in larger hard drives
* `replace_mirrored_disk` Replace a failed disk in a Linux software mirror
